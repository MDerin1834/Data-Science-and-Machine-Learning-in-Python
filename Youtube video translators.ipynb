      "gate\n",
      "is essentially an and gate\n",

      "so we have one and three\n",
      "then we have\n",
      "two and four\n",
      "so basically as you can see we divided\n",
      "it into the input and output of the and\n",
      "gates\n",

      "so in this his case scenario we're going\n",

      "circuit\n",
      "now we're going to get into how we're\n",

      "when we get into this though we the\n",
      "first thing that we do when we try to\n",
      "convert an\n",
      "and or to a nand gate is we're going to\n",
      "put bubbles at all the outputs and\n",
      "inputs of the gates right so we have\n",
      "lines over here that connect to the\n",
      "input\n",
      "and output we're gonna put inverting\n",
      "bubbles\n",
      "over all of them and we're gonna do the\n",

      "well\n",
      "so we're gonna put inverting bubbles on\n",
      "every input and output\n",
      "so as you can see here we have inverting\n",
      "bubbles on everything all right and then\n",
      "now what's the first\n",
      "that's this rule that we did at the\n",
      "beginning we can see right here that\n",
      "these two or gates can automatically\n",
      "come nand because we added inverting\n",
      "bubbles right\n",
      "and the reason why we added to the input\n",
      "and the output\n",
      "of the and gates or the or gates is\n",
      "because whatever we do to one side we\n",
      "have to do to the outside\n",
      "so if we do something to the output over\n",
      "here so if we do something to the output\n",
      "over here\n",
      "we have to do it to the input over here\n",
      "that's just the basic rule of\n",
      "mathematics\n",
      "that whatever we do to the left side we\n",
      "have to do it to the right side\n",
      "so that's why we added the inverting\n",
      "bubbles and the output and the input\n",
      "so based on our rule that we did before\n",
      "we know that an or gate\n",
      "right we know that or gate with two\n",
      "inverting bubbles\n",
      "is equivalent to just a regular nand\n",
      "gate right\n",
      "so that's exactly how we got rid of our\n",
      "or gates right away so if we line this\n",
      "up over here\n",
      "right with the this junction these two\n",
      "or gates\n",
      "essentially become nand gates so you\n",
      "have a nand gate over here\n",
      "and we have a nand gate over here so\n",
      "these two ores become a nand gate\n",
      "automatically\n",
      "now if we look at this section over here\n",
      "we see that because we added these\n",
      "inverting bubbles at the output\n",
      "they essentially become to look like\n",
      "atlanta gates right\n",
      "and then these inverting bubbles\n",
      "essentially then become inverters\n",
      "as you can see here so these inverting\n",
      "bubbles that are here already\n",
      "they become inverters but because we\n",
      "added an inverting bubble at the end\n",
      "these essentially become nand gates and\n",
      "the reason why these inverting bubbles\n",
      "are allowed\n",
      "because they're not pre-existing in the\n",
      "circuit and also these inverting bubbles\n",
      "are just the generic way of how to draw\n",
      "and gates as it's the\n",
      "uh the generic wave how people associate\n",
      "nand gates with them\n",
      "right so that is part of the design of\n",
      "how the nand gate is drawn\n",
      "so as you can see here we see have\n",
      "inverting gates for these nand gates\n",
      "right\n",
      "and then we end up having four nand\n",
      "gates\n",
      "we end up having four nand gates and\n",
      "then there are inverters on some of them\n",
      "right so we have two on the bottom for\n",
      "the two inputs\n",
      "we have one on the second one and we\n",
      "have one on the first one\n",
      "right so that's what the first side of\n",
      "the circuit looks like so we have these\n",
      "two ores\n",
      "with and we add the two inverting\n",
      "bubbles and they become nand gates then\n",
      "we add bubbles to the output of these\n",
      "and gates and then we change these\n",
      "circles\n",
      "or these bubble inverters into real\n",
      "inverters and we add\n",
      "nand gates through all of them right and\n",
      "these are just regular inputs whatever's\n",
      "left\n",
      "right so now that we have that we know\n",
      "what basically\n",
      "this first half of the circuit looks\n",
      "like now we have to do the second half\n",
      "of the circuit\n",
      "so once again we see this or here with\n",
      "the two circles so we know for this\n",
      "section\n",
      "this is just going to be a big nand gate\n",
      "as this is equivalent\n",
      "as it was over here right so we go that\n",
      "this final circuit is going to be a nand\n",
      "gate\n",
      "now what about these two and gates over\n",
      "here we know that these essentially\n",
      "become nand gates as well\n",
      "right because there's an and gate and we\n",
      "just added the inverter at the end\n",
      "but these two inputs are regular but\n",
      "this input has a bubble inverter so then\n",
      "instead for this input we have to put\n",
      "another regular inverter over here\n",
      "to make it make sense where there's no\n",
      "bubbles allowed right so now we have two\n",
      "more nand gates\n",
      "associated over here and then now this\n",
      "inverter is placed in front of this\n",
      "first input for the top and gate so then\n",
      "it all makes sense and it doesn't change\n",
      "the\n",
      "output that is resulted from the circuit\n",
      "so this essentially what we're doing for\n",
      "this circuit is very simple\n",
      "so basically what we have to do is\n",
      "basically change these and to nands\n",
      "which is relatively simple we just add a\n",
      "bubble at the end\n",
      "but the real trick is to remember that\n",
      "these or gates with these two bubbles\n",
      "are equivalent to the nand gates and we\n",
      "have to convert them\n",
      "right so that's the main trick that we\n",
      "have to make sure to do\n",
      "and that's why we essentially chose the\n",
      "second and the fourth junction to work\n",
      "with\n",
      "because that is what would make it the\n",
      "most simplest as we can just put the\n",
      "bubbles at the or gates\n",
      "and convert them to nand gates easily\n",
      "all right\n",
      "so then i know this is a it's a very\n",
      "easy example if you guys want to do\n",
      "another one i can do an xor example or\n",
      "whatever other circuit you guys want me\n",
      "to convert so if you have any other\n",
      "circuits you want me to convert please\n",
      "comment down below\n",
      "or send me an email at sharinacademy\n",
      "gmail.com\n",
      "i'll make sure to make another video on\n",
      "it as soon as possible\n",
      "right so essentially it's what a circuit\n",
      "looks like and then right now i'm going\n",
      "to attach\n",
      "what the full circuit is supposed to be\n",
      "look like uh with the whole design\n",
      "below and we can take a look at compare\n",
      "them okay so as you can see here\n",
      "we have this fully drawn out circuit now\n",
      "and as you can see here we have our four\n",
      "nand gates and we have the inverter\n",
      "and these two inverters at the bottom\n",
      "and in this one as you can see if you\n",
      "follow the actual line of the circuit\n",
      "we have b as the input over here and\n",
      "this is connected to this inverter right\n",
      "and this also goes down and connects to\n",
      "this inverter\n",
      "then we have a coming down and connects\n",
      "to this inverter so as you can see here\n",
      "if we follow this we have a\n",
      "the inverter comes and it comes all the\n",
      "way down here then we have b\n",
      "as the inverter connects to this one but\n",
      "it also has a line down coming down to\n",
      "here so that therefore\n",
      "we get all the inverters necessary as a\n",
      "also connects to the first navigate on\n",
      "the top\n",
      "so as you can see our first uh row or\n",
      "column of nand gates is correct as all\n",
      "our inverters are in place with the\n",
      "circuit drawn\n",
      "and all the inputs are designed to enter\n",
      "the right nand gates\n",
      "as you can see down below now in the\n",
      "next section\n",
      "you can see our two or gates over here\n",
      "with after adding the inverting bubbles\n",
      "are then converted into these two nand\n",
      "gates which are correct\n",
      "and as you can see here we have our two\n",
      "and gates right so these two nand gates\n",
      "are created\n",
      "and the inverting bubble that is over\n",
      "here from\n",
      "input number c as you can see c here if\n",
      "you follow it\n",
      "it goes and has an inverting right\n",
      "inverter over here which\n",
      "in turn becomes one of the outputs for\n",
      "the nand gate\n",
      "and but for the other one the c value is\n",
      "just a regular one so if we follow the c\n",
      "it comes down and there's no inverter\n",
      "that is needed and there's just a\n",
      "regular input\n",
      "as if we have over here right so these\n",
      "two and gates become the nand gates and\n",
      "we have one of the inverters\n",
      "that are needed for the input and then\n",
      "these last or gate with the two\n",
      "inverting bubbles at the end\n",
      "are then placed on this and so then\n",
      "therefore we have\n",
      "our nand gate to finish it off right and\n",
      "then we have f as our output\n",
      "to result in the same result as the\n",
      "previous circuit but now we're just\n",
      "using nand gates instead of and and or\n",
      "gates right\n",
      "so essentially if i can erase this real\n",
      "quick\n",
      "essentially this is what our final\n",
      "circuit should look like with the\n",
      "correct format of only using two input\n",
      "nand gates\n",
      "with no inverting bubbles allowed as we\n",
      "can use inverters however\n",
